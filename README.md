This repository contains a JavaScript code example demonstrating an uncommon bug related to null value handling. The `foo` function exhibits unexpected behavior when null values are passed as arguments. The original code silently returns without explicit error handling for null cases. The solution demonstrates a robust approach to handle nulls explicitly, either by throwing an error or providing a default value, thus improving code clarity and reliability.
